# odin-formValidation
This is the form validation project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about building a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password confirmation fields using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index file, a css file and javascript file.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my knowledge around JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Self-reflection and conclusion:
project finished in the branch versionTwo, this was an opportunity to practice one more time JavaScrip form validation.
